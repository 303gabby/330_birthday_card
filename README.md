# Birthday Card Project

## Overview
This project is a simple **Birthday Card** created using only **HTML and CSS**. It was designed as a **class exercise** to practice basic tags and css properties. The card features a cover image and a hidden birthday message that is revealed when the user hovers over the card.

## Inspiration
The design was inspired by a physical card advertised by **Caroline Gardner** [here](https://carolinegardner.com/cdn/shop/files/PSI002.jpg?v=1719483672). **Full credit goes to Caroline Gardner** for the original design. I wanted to take the concept of their card and bring it to life in a **digital format** using web technologies.

## Features
- Pure **HTML and CSS**, no JavaScript.  
- **Hover effect** that reveals the birthday message.  
- Clean typography using the **Quicksand** font from Google Fonts.  

 

## Learning Outcomes
Through this exercise, I practiced:  
- Structuring HTML for layered content.  
- Styling elements with CSS, including positioning and transitions.  
- Using typography and visual design to enhance a simple web project.
